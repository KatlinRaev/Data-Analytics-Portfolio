# Weekly Retention Cohort Analysis

## Task Overview
The objective is to analyze subscription churn through a weekly retention lens, as requested by the Product Manager. Monthly retention data can obscure timely insights, so this task focuses on creating weekly retention cohorts to identify trends and patterns.

## Approach
1. **Data Source**:
   - Use the `turing_data_analytics.subscriptions` table in BigQuery to extract subscription data.

2. **SQL Query**:
   - Write a SQL query to calculate weekly cohorts showing:
     - Subscribers who started their subscription in a given week (Week 0).
     - Retention data for the next six weeks (Week 1 to Week 6).

3. **Visualization**:
   - Generate retention cohort tables and visualizations using tools such as Google Sheets, Tableau, or Looker Studio.
   - Highlight retention rates for quick interpretation.

4. **Analysis Date**:
   - Assume the analysis is performed on `2021-02-07`.

## Deliverables
1. **SQL Query**:
   - Extract weekly cohort data.
2. **Visualizations**:
   - Heatmaps for retention rates.
   - Line charts showing retention over time.
3. **Insights**:
   - Key findings and actionable recommendations based on the data.

## Next Steps
1. Develop the SQL query.
2. Visualize the data using your preferred tool.
3. Share insights and recommendations in the report.
