# RFM and CLV Analysis

This repository contains all files and resources for the RFM and CLV analysis tasks completed as part of the Turing College data analytics sprint. The analysis focuses on two major projects:

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing customer data to provide actionable insights on customer segments and lifetime value. The repository includes:
- **SQL Queries**: For data extraction and calculations.
- **Power BI Dashboards**: For data visualization.
- **Supplementary Documents**: Summaries and detailed analysis.

### 1. **RFM Analysis**
- **Objective**: Segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) scores to identify target customer groups for marketing.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Power BI dashboard file.
  - PDF version of the dashboard.
  - Excel file with additional overviews.
  - SQL queries used for analysis.

### 2. **CLV Analysis**
- **Objective**: Predict customer lifetime value (CLV) using cohort-based methods by calculating average and cumulative weekly revenue.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Excel file with analysis.
  - SQL queries used for cohort and revenue calculations.

## Data Sources
- **RFM Data**: The `rfm` table under the `turing_data_analytics` database.
- **CLV Data**: The `raw_events` table, representing user activity and purchase events.

## How to Use
1. **RFM Analysis**:
   - Open the Power BI dashboard for a visual overview of customer segmentation.
   - Use the SQL queries in the `/SQL` folder to replicate data extraction and calculation processes.
   - Refer to the Excel file for a detailed overview of RFM segmentation.

2. **CLV Analysis**:
   - Check the Excel file for cohort-based revenue calculations and insights.
   - Use the SQL queries in the `/SQL` folder to replicate the CLV analysis.

## Insights
- **RFM Analysis**: Identifies key customer segments, enabling targeted marketing strategies.
- **CLV Analysis**: Provides revenue forecasts to inform decision-making on customer retention and acquisition efforts.
