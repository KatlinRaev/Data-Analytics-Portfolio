- Pop and hip-hop are likely to continue leading the charts, with their strong presence in danceability and loudness.

- For genres like Alternative/Indie, the focus on acoustic and less electronic production may appeal to a niche audience, which could drive their future growth, especially in live performances or specialized media.

- The dominance of certain albums (e.g., Dua Lipa's "Future Nostalgia") and artists indicates that trends are often shaped by the output of a few key influencers in the industry.
